            <p>
                My name is Nicole Formenti, <br>
                I was born and raised in Switzerland and I moved to Belfast, Northern Ireland in 2018. <br> 
                I have a Master degree in Italian Linguistics, <br>
                but I developed an interest in coding while working in the sales department of Microsoft. <br>
                I graduated from the Bath Spa University Web Development Bootcamp in August 2023 <br>
                and I've been working on my skills ever since, participating in different online classes. <br>
                I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, but I use Figma as my go-to design tools <br>
                and I have a very good knowledge of WordPress and Shopify. <br>
                I have been working with APIs and local storage, and I'm working towards becoming a full-stack developer. <br>
