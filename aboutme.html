            <p>
                My name is Nicole Formenti, <br>
                I was born and raised in Switzerland and I moved to Belfast, Northern Ireland in 2018. <br><br> 
                I have a Master degree in Italian Linguistics, 
                but I developed an interest in coding while working in the sales department of Microsoft. <br><br>
                I graduated from the Bath Spa University's Web Development Bootcamp in August 2023, where I learnt
                to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, as well as external APIs and local storage. <br><br>
                I've been working on my skills ever since, participating in different online classes.
                I'm currently following Free Code Camp's Front End Development Libraries course, 
                which covers Bootstrap, jQuery, Sass and Redux, and the University of Helskinki's Full Stack Development course, where I'm 
                learning React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript. <br><br>
                I use Figma as my go-to design tool, and I have a very good knowledge of WordPress and Shopify.
